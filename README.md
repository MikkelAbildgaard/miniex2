Coding Process

The first step in my coding process was designing the cartoon character. The design was executed by abstract ideas, which was supposed to make the cartoon character simple through known human-like features. The character has both feet, a mouth and eyes. One of the tougher tasks in this mini exercise was expressing either glitches, errors or noises. In this specific project the idea was based on the cartoon characters "survival" through the glitches. Several noise codes were added in the program to express the glitch between the cartoon character and his "survival". Besides this, an ellipse follows the cursor around, which is supposed to function as an error.

Coding Process

The first step in my coding process was designing the cartoon character. The design was executed by abstract ideas, which was supposed to make the cartoon character simple through known human-like features. The character has both feet, a mouth and eyes. One of the tougher tasks in this mini exercise was expressing either glitches, errors or noises. In this specific project the idea was based on the cartoon characters "survival" through the glitches. Several noise codes were added in the program to express the glitch between the cartoon character and his "survival". Besides this, an ellipse follows the cursor around, which is supposed to function as an error. Another element in my coding process was the try and error method. After adding codings i would test the specified code, and hereby elaborate if it had given the desired effect. 

The Constitution of a Program

A program consists of a set different codes, which purpose is to solve any given task. When solved the given task, a desired result should be the outcome. It could be a possibility to divide the program into two parts. A "background" part, where the codes and commands are programmed and a part where the program is visualized. 

The Notion of Error

I would characterize an error as a failure of a given task or an unexpected result. An error is abstract phenomena and is not only reservered in the world of computing. However in the world of computing, programming and sofware, error is relevant for several parts. Both the programmer and the user can experience error although they might have a different perception of the error. Whenever a given program or software fails to satisfy either the programmer or the user, it can be seen as an error.
